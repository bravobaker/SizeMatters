## Mann-Whitney Test for Absolute Size experiment

These are [Archi](https://github.com/bravobaker/SizeMatters/tree/main/27:06%20re-count%20MW%20for%20absolute%20size/ARCHI) and [Lak](https://github.com/bravobaker/SizeMatters/tree/main/27:06%20re-count%20MW%20for%20absolute%20size/LAK) folders, each containing 12 datasets:

* 6 datasets with animals included
* 6 datasets with animals excluded

and there is also [Katya's code](https://github.com/bravobaker/SizeMatters/blob/main/27:06%20re-count%20MW%20for%20absolute%20size/Mann_Whitney_Test.ipynb).
If you run the code on both Archi and Lak data you will get strikingly different results: there will be no difference in distribution of genders for Archi, but you will get it for Lak
